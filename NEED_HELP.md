## Registering a Product and Creating a Security Profile

After creating an Amazon developer account, you'll need to [register a product and create a security profile](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/register-a-product.html) on the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) developer portal.

When you follow the instructions to [fill in the product information](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/register-a-product.html#fill-in-product-information):

* Use your own custom information, taking note of the **Product ID**.
* Be sure to select **Automotive** from the **Product category** pull-down.

When you follow the instructions to [set up your security profile](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/register-a-product.html#set-up-your-security-profile), take note of the generated **Client ID**.
